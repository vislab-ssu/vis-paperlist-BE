        "abstract": "There exists a gulf between the rhetoric in visualisation research about the significance of uncertainty and the inclusion of representations of uncertainty in visualisations used in practice. The graphical representation of uncertainty information has emerged as a problem of great importance in visualisation research. This contribution presents a survey of 286 uncertainty visualisation research publications. All publications are categorised with regard to publication type, publication venue, application domain, target user, and evaluation type. We present an interactive web-based browser that facilitates easy visual search and exploration of the publications included in the survey. We conclude that uncertainty visualisation is severely limited by the quality and scope of uncertainty data, by the limited confidence in the data, and by the perceptual and cognitive confusion that the graphical representation of the data can generate."

        "abstract": "Hierarchical structures are very common in the real world for recording all kinds of relational data generated in our daily life and business procedures. A very popular visualization method for displaying such data structures is called \"Tree\". So far, there are a variety of Tree visualization methods that have been proposed and most of them can only visualize one hierarchical dataset at a time. Hence, it raises the difficulty of comparison between two or more hierarchical datasets.In this paper, we proposed Pansy Tree which used a tree metaphor to visualize merged hierarchies. We design a unique icon named pansy to represent each merged node in the structure. Each Pansy is encoded by three colors mapping data items from three different datasets in the same hierarchical position (or tree node). The petals and sepal on Pansy are designed for showing each attribute’s values and hierarchical information. We also redefine the links in force layout encoded by width and animation to better convey hierarchical information. We further apply Pansy Tree into CNCEE datasets and demonstrate two use cases to verify its effectiveness.The main contribution of this work is to merge three datasets into one tree that makes it much easier to explore and compare the structures, data items and data attributes with visual tools."

We also present algorithms to compute the symmetry quality metrics in O(n log n) time. We validate our symmetry quality metrics using deformation experiments. We then use the metrics to evaluate existing graph layouts to compare how faithfully they display geometric automorphisms of a graph as symmetries."

One of the most important steps in the process is to compare generated substantial amounts of ML models to find the optimal one for the deployment. It is challenging to compare such models with dynamic number of features. This paper proposes a novel visualisation approach based on a radial net to compare ML models trained with a different number of features of a given data set while revealing implicit dependent relations. In the proposed approach, ML models and features are represented by lines and arcs respectively. The dependence of ML models with dynamic number of features is encoded into the structure of visualisation, where ML models and their dependent features are directly revealed from related line connections. ML model performance information is encoded with colour and line width in the innovative visualisation. Together with the structure of visualization, feature importance can be directly discerned to help to understand ML models."

SSR-VFD is the first work that advocates a machine learning approach to generate high-resolution vector fields from low-resolution ones. The core of SSR-VFD lies in the use of three separate neural nets that take the three components of a low-resolution vector field as input and jointly output a synthesized high-resolution vector field. To capture spatial coherence, we take into account magnitude and angle losses in network optimization. Our method can work in the in situ scenario where VFD are down-sampled at simulation time for storage saving and these reduced VFD are upsampled back to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-VFD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several vector field data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation, and two solutions based on CNN and GAN, respectively."

Meanwhile, data information can also be retrieved by parsing visual marks with extracted mapping relationships. Then a 1-D convolutional residual network is employed to analyze the relationship between visual elements, and recognize significant features of the visualization charts, with both data and visual information as input. In the final step, the full description of the visual charts can be generated through a template-based approach. The generated captions can effectively cover the main visual features of the visual charts and support major feature types in commons charts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several cases."

        "abstract": "Recent attempts at utilizing visual analytics to interpret Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) mainly focus on natural language processing (NLP) tasks that take symbolic sequences as input. However, many real-world problems like environment pollution forecasting apply RNNs on sequences of multi-dimensional data where each dimension represents an individual feature with semantic meaning such as PM2.5 and SO2. RNN interpretation on multi-dimensional sequences is challenging as users need to analyze what features are important at different time steps to better understand model behavior and gain trust in prediction. This requires effective and scalable visualization methods to reveal the complex many-to-many relations between hidden units and features. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system to interpret RNNs on multi-dimensional time-series forecasts. Specifically, to provide an overview to reveal the model mechanism, we propose a technique to estimate the hidden unit response by measuring how different feature selections affect the hidden unit output distribution. We then cluster the hidden units and features based on the response embedding vectors. Finally, we propose a visual analytics system which allows users to visually explore the model behavior from the global and individual levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with case studies using air pollutant forecast applications."

The results show that participants were able to interpret network structure more accurately when viewing the network in an immersive environment, particularly for larger networks. However, we found that 2D visualizations performed better than immersive visualization for tasks that required spatial memory."

We define the preservation of critical points as, without any false positive, false negative, or false type change in the decompressed data, (1) keeping each critical point in its original cell and (2) retaining the type of each critical point (e.g., saddle and attracting node). The key to our method is to adapt a vertex-wise error bound for each grid point and to compress input data together with the error bound field using a modified lossy compressor. Our compression algorithm can be also embarrassingly parallelized for large data handling and in situ processing. We benchmark our method by comparing it with existing lossy compressors in terms of false positive/negative/type rates, compression ratio, and various vector field visualizations with several scientific applications."

Several visual parameters can be tweaked to change the visual appearance and readability of the plots: among others, a space-reclaiming parameter, an empty space shrinking parameter, and a gap size. To illustrate the usefulness of the novel visualization technique we applied it, among others, to an NCBI taxonomy dataset consisting of more than 300,000 elements and with maximum depth 42.

To visualize uncertainty in a rectangular treemap, we identify two conflicting key requirements: (i) to assess the data value of a node in the hierarchy, the area of its rectangle should directly match its data value, and (ii) to facilitate comparison between data and uncertainty, uncertainty should be encoded using the same visual variable as the data, that is, area. We present Uncertainty Treemaps, which meet both requirements simultaneously by introducing the concept of hierarchical uncertainty masks. First, we define a new cost function that measures the quality of Uncertainty Treemaps. Then, we show how to adapt existing treemapping algorithms to support uncertainty masks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and quality of our technique through an expert review and a computational experiment on real-world datasets."

However, applying RL to real-world tasks like robot control is still challenging. Because generating a massive number of samples to train control policies using RL on real robots is very expensive, hence impractical, it is common to train in simulations, and then transfer to real environments. The trained policy, however, may fail in the real world because of the difference between the training and the real environments, especially the difference in dynamics. To diagnose the problems, it is crucial for experts to understand (1) how the trained policy behaves under different dynamics settings, (2) which part of the policy affects the behaviors the most when the dynamics setting changes, and (3) how to adjust the training procedure to make the policy robust.This paper presents DynamicsExplorer, a visual analytics tool to diagnose the trained policy on robot control tasks under different dynamics settings. DynamicsExplorer allows experts to overview the results of multiple tests with different dynamics-related parameter settings so experts can visually detect failures and analyze the sensitivity of different parameters. Experts can further examine the internal activations of the policy for selected tests and compare the activations between success and failure tests. Such comparisons help experts form hypotheses about the policy and allows them to verify the hypotheses via DynamicsExplorer. Multiple use cases are presented to demonstrate the utility of DynamicsExplorer."

Analyzing large streaming data is challenging because the rate of receiving data and limited time to comprehend data make it difficult for the analysts to sufficiently examine the data without missing important changes or patterns. To support streaming data analysis, we introduce a visual analytic framework comprising of three modules: data management, analysis, and interactive visualization. The data management module collects various computing and communication performance metrics from the monitored system using streaming data processing techniques and feeds the data to the other two modules. The analysis module automatically identifies important changes and patterns at the required latency. In particular, we introduce a set of online and progressive analysis methods for not only controlling the computational costs but also helping analysts better follow the critical aspects of the analysis results. Finally, the interactive visualization module provides the analysts with a coherent view of the changes and patterns in the continuously captured performance data. Through a multi-faceted case study on performance analysis of parallel discrete-event simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for identifying bottlenecks and locating outliers."

        "abstract": "Conventional attention visualization tools compromise either the readability or the information conveyed when documents are lengthy, especially when these documents have imbalanced sizes. Our work strives toward a more intuitive visualization for a subset of Natural Language Processing tasks, where attention is mapped between documents with imbalanced sizes. We extend the flow map visualization to enhance the readability of the attention-augmented documents. Through interaction, our design enables semantic filtering that helps users prioritize important tokens and meaningful matching for an in-depth exploration. Case studies and informal user studies in machine comprehension prove that our visualization effectively helps users gain initial understandings about what their models are \"paying attention to.\" We discuss how the work can be extended to other domains, as well as being plugged into more end-to-end systems for model error analysis."

        "abstract": "Two fundamental problems in machine learning are recognition and generation. Apart from the tremendous amount of research efforts devoted to these two problems individually, finding the association between them has attracted increasingly more attention recently. Symbol-Concept Association Network (SCAN) is one of the most popular models for this problem proposed by Google DeepMind lately, which integrates an unsupervised concept abstraction process and a supervised symbol-concept association process. Despite the outstanding performance of this deep neural network, interpreting and evaluating it remain challenging. Guided by the practical needs from deep learning experts, this paper proposes a visual analytics attempt, i.e., SCANViz, to address this challenge in the visual domain. Specifically, SCANViz evaluates the performance of SCAN through its power of recognition and generation, facilitates the exploration of the latent space derived from both the unsupervised extraction and supervised association processes, empowers interactive training of SCAN to interpret the model’s understanding on a particular visual concept. Through concrete case studies with multiple deep learning experts, we validate the effectiveness of SCANViz."

But in a highly immersive virtual environment, traditional single-channel precise interactive methods cannot be applied directly to the immersive environment. Inspired by how users typically interact with everyday objects, a novel non-contact gesture interaction method base on What You See is What You Get(WYSIWYG)for volume rendering results is proposed in this paper. Just likes grab interaction in real scene, a full set of tools have been developed to enable direct volume rendering manipulation of color, saturation, contrast, brightness, and other optical properties by gestural motions in our method. Simultaneously, in order to improve the interactive experience in immersive environment, the evaluation model of motion comfort is introduced to design the interactive hand gestures, the cursor model is defined to estimating the gesture state combined with context gestural motions. Finally, the test platform is established with Oculus Rift + Leap Motion to verify the functionality and effectiveness of our method in improving the visual cognitive ability for volume visualization."

However, we find limited discussion and empirical measurement of peer review in visualization coursework. In addition to engagement, peer review provides direct and diverse feedback and reinforces recently-learned course concepts through critical evaluation of others’ work. In this paper, we discuss the construction and application of peer review in a computer science visualization course, including: projects that reuse code and visualizations in a feedback-guided, continual improvement process and a peer review rubric to reinforce key course concepts. To measure the effectiveness of the approach, we evaluate student projects, peer review text, and a post-course questionnaire from 3 semesters of mixed undergraduate and graduate courses. The results indicate that course concepts are reinforced with peer review—82% reported learning more because of peer review, and 75% of students recommended continuing it. Finally, we provide a road-map for adapting peer review to other visualization courses to produce more highly engaged students."

To visualize large-scale graphs, several parallel algorithms have been discussed in the literature. However, existing parallel algorithms do not utilize memory hierarchy efficiently and often offer limited parallelism. This paper addresses these limitations with BatchLayout, an algorithm that groups vertices into minibatches and processes them in parallel. BatchLayout also employs cache blocking techniques to utilize memory hierarchy efficiently. More parallelism and improved memory accesses coupled with force approximating techniques, better initialization, and optimized learning rate make BatchLayout significantly faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms such as ForceAtlas2 and OpenOrd. The visualization quality of layouts from BatchLayout is comparable or better than similar visualization tools.

One part of this process is to find the optimal stress-aware design under given geometric constraints and loading conditions. Tensor visualization provides techniques to show and evaluate the stress distribution based on finite element method simulations. One such technique are hyperstreamlines. They allow us to explore the stress along a line following one principal stress direction while showing the other principal stress directions and their values. In this paper, we show shortcomings of this approach from an engineer’s point of view and propose a variant called tensor spines. It provides an improved perception of the relation between the principal stresses helping engineers to optimize their designs further."

With the increase of computing power, billions of particles of high space-time fidelity can be simulated by supercomputers. However, limited computer storage can only hold a small subset of the simulation output for analysis, which makes the understanding of the underlying cosmological phenomena difficult. To alleviate the problem, we design an in-situ data reduction method for large-scale unstructured particle data. During the data generation phase, we use a combined k-dimensional partitioning and Gaussian mixture model approach to reduce the data by utilizing probability distributions. We offer a model evaluation criterion to examine the quality of the probabilistic distribution models, which allows us to identify and improve low-quality models. After the in-situ processing, the particle data size is greatly reduced, which satisfies the requirements from the domain experts. By comparing the astronomical attributes and visualizations of the reconstructed data with the raw data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our in-situ particle data reduction technique."

In these situations, it can be helpful for decision makers to model and visually compare their preferences in order to better understand each others’ points of view. Although a number of tools for preference modelling and inspection exist, none are based on detailed data and task models that capture the demands of group decision making in particular. This paper is a first step in addressing this gap. By going through the four stages of the nested model of visualization design, we have developed and tested a prototype to support group decision making when decision makers express their preferences directly on the alternatives."

They first identify trends or anomalies from a global view and then examine details in a local view. Specifically, we train a neural network to project high-dimensional data to a two dimensional (2D) planar space while retaining global data distances. By aligning the 2D points with a predefined color map, high-dimensional data can be represented by colors. Because perceptual color differentiation may fail to reflect data distance, we optimize perceptual color differentiation on each map region by deformation. The region with large perceptual color differentiation will expand, whereas the region with small differentiation will shrink. Since colors do not occupy any space in visualization, we convey the overview of multivariate time series data by a calendar view. Cells in the view are color-coded to represent multivariate data at different time spans. Users can observe color changes over time to identify events of interest. Afterward, they study details of an event by examining parallel coordinate plots. Cells in the calendar view and the parallel coordinate plots are dynamically linked for users to obtain insights that are barely noticeable in large datasets. The experiment results, comparisons, conducted case studies, and the user study indicate that our visualization system is feasible and effective."

Analyzing these unique temporal datasets poses a significant challenge for domain experts, due to the complex and often incomplete data, for which corresponding exploratory tools are not available. In this paper, we present a novel visual analysis tool for extraction and interactive exploration of temporal measurements captured at the polar station at the James Ross Island in Antarctica. The tool allows domain experts to quickly extract information about the snow level, originating from a series of photos acquired by trail cameras. Using linked views, the domain experts can interactively explore and combine this information with other spatial and non-spatial measures, such as temperature or wind speed, to reveal the interplay of periglacial and aeolian processes. An abstracted interactive map of the area indicates the position of measurement spots to facilitate navigation. The design of the tool was made in tight collaboration with geographers, which resulted in an early prototype, tested in the pilot study. The following version of the tool and its usability has been evaluated in the user study with five domain experts and their feedback was incorporated into the final version, presented in this paper. This version was again discussed with two experts in an informal interview. Within these evaluations, they confirmed the significant benefit of the tool for their research tasks."

        "abstract": "Data tours follow an exploratory multi-dimensional data visualization concept that provides animations of projections of the multidimensional data to a 2D visual space. To create an animation, a sequence of key projections is provided and morphings between each pair of consecutive key projections are computed, which then can be stitched together to form the data tour. The morphings should be smooth so that a user can easily follow the transformations, and their computations shall be fast to allow for their integration into an interactive visual exploration process. Moreover, if the key projections are chosen to satisfy additional conditions, it is desirable that these conditions are maintained during morphing. Shape preservation is such a desirable condition, as it avoids shape distortions that may otherwise be caused by a projection. We develop a novel efficient morphing algorithms for computing shape-preserving data tours, i.e., data tours constructed for a sequence of shape-preserving linear projections. We propose a stepping strategy for the morphing to avoid discontinuities in the evolution of the projections, where we represent the linear projections using a star-coordinates system. Our algorithms are less computationally involved, produce smoother morphings, and require less user-defined parameter settings than existing state-of-the-art approaches."

        "abstract": "We introduce a new technique to visualize complex flowing phenomena by using concepts from shape analysis. Our approach uses techniques that examine the intrinsic geometry of manifolds through their heat kernel, to obtain representations of such manifolds that are isometry-invariant and multi-scale. These representations permit us to compute heat kernel signatures of each point on that manifold, and we can use these signatures as features for classification and segmentation that identify points that have similar structural properties. Our approach adapts heat kernel signatures to unsteady flows by formulating a notion of shape where pathlines are observations of a manifold living in a high-dimensional space. We use this space to compute and visualize heat kernel signatures associated with each pathline. Besides being able to capture the structural features of a pathline, heat kernel signatures allow the comparison of pathlines from different flow datasets through a shape matching pipeline. We demonstrate the analytic power of heat kernel signatures by comparing both (1) different timesteps from the same unsteady flow as well as (2) flow datasets taken from ensemble simulations with varying simulation parameters. Our analysis only requires the pathlines themselves, and thus it does not utilize the underlying vector field directly. We make minimal assumptions on the pathlines: while we assume they are sampled from a continuous, unsteady flow, our computations can tolerate pathlines that have varying density and potential unknown boundaries. We evaluate our approach through visualizations of a variety of two-dimensional unsteady flows."

In our proposed approach, the data and task behaviors are visualized through a graph with a fine-designed layout, in which node glyphs are dedicated to showing the status of processes and the links represent the data or task transfer between different computation rounds and processes.
