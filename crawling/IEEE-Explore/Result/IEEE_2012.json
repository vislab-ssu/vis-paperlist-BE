In the design of these systems it is important to appraise the motor performance across the entire torque-speed envelope. This paper presents computationally efficient techniques that allow rapid and accurate modelling of the entire operational envelope of any BLAC PM motor, enabling the generation of torque/speed characteristics and loss maps that can be used in an iterative design process. The proposed techniques are validated against test data from an in-house 35kW interior PM motor design and a comparison between a measured and computed efficiency map for the 2004 Toyota Prius motor is undertaken."

The macroscopic parameters d- and q-axis insulation ratios, kwq and kwd, respectively, are introduced. They describe fully the geometry characteristic of the p-pole pair, two barrier rotor. The presented combined analytical-FEM approach gives the optimal distribution of air and iron for the maximum torque. Saturation effects and other two dimensional nonlinearities are included by a limited number of FEM simulations to determine the best kwq and kwd. The method is shown to obtain the maximum torque accurately and fast for a specific stator without directly dealing with the rotor geometry dimensions."

An important observation from the study is that the operation of the converter is affected, not only by the magnitude of this impedance (quantified by the Short Circuit Ratio or SCR), but also significantly by its angle. An interesting result is that the larger the resistive component (i.e. impedance angle less than 90°), the larger is the minimum SCR required at the rectifier. The trend at the inverter end is the opposite, and the inverter is able to operate into systems with smaller SCR. Although operation is theoretically possible at the analytically calculated minimum SCRs, the paper shows that as the ac system approaches this value, the gains of the phase locked loop (PLL) used for angle reference generation must be reduced."

Two techniques are usually used for implementing the P&O algorithm: reference voltage perturbation where a reference value for the PV generator output voltage is used as the control parameter and direct duty ratio perturbation where the duty ratio of the MPPT converter is used directly as the control parameter. This paper presents an experimental comparison between these two techniques when used in a photovoltaic system feeding a resistive load. The influence of the step size and the speed at which the control parameter is perturbed is investigated. The various advantages and drawbacks of each technique are identified and energy utilization efficiency is calculated for different weather conditions. Practical results obtained using a 540Wp PV experimental setup show very good agreement with numerical simulations."

However, VSCs susceptibility to DC faults, particularly the potential damage caused to the converter IGBTs due to overcurrent, is an issue that must be addressed. This paper analyses the behaviour of a VSC-based HVDC system under varying DC fault conditions. A two terminal multi-terminal DC system, consisting of a single sending and receiving end is used as a case study. Recharging of the DC link Capacitor after a DC line-to-line fault was found to act as additional damping for the AC fault current, helping to reduce the AC current offset. Also, it was discovered that the development of potential earth loops with the system as a result of DC lineto-earth faults can lead to substantial overcurrent if an effective earthing scheme is not in place."

This paper analyses a High Voltage (HV) DC/DC converter utilising an intermediate AC link between two modular multi-level converters (MMC) based on the Alternate Arm Converter (AAC) topology. System operation is demonstrated using a detailed Simulink simulation. Power loss estimates derived from the simulation are used to illustrate the dependence of efficiency on design choices and operating point.

To this end, a Newton quadratic interpolation based control strategy for the PV system is presented in this paper. With this novel strategy, the PV system can work on the dispatchable mode to flexibly adjust the active power output in some range, and it will automatically switch to the MPPT mode if necessary.

Installing the DGs near end-customers result in reduction of power transmission of lines, however, if a large amount of microDGs generate energy simultaneously, it may result in distribution system congestion.

Genetic algorithm is used to determine the optimal configuration. Numerical results of implementing the method on a test system demonstrate that network reconfiguration can be used as an effective methodology to defer the additional investment in distribution systems."

        "abstract": "Research and development within piezoelectric transformer (PT) based converters are rapidly increasing, as the technology is maturing and starts to prove its capabilities. High power density and high efficiencies are reported and recently several inductor-less converters have emerged [1][2][7][10][13], which demonstrates soft switching capabilities. The elimination of a bulky inductor, reduces size and price of the converter, but demands a soft switching optimised PT. Several attempts of expressing the soft switching capability have been made [5][12], with some shortcomings. The goal of this paper is to derive a simple expression of the maximal obtainable soft switching capability (ZVS factor), for a specific PT design, assuming a matched load. The expression has been derived through series of parametric sweep simulations of the inductor-less half- bridge topology, which revealed that a linearization of the maximal soft switching capability can be performed, in the area of interest. This expression is intended to form a basic tool for development of soft switching optimised PT's, which enables the utilisation of inductor-less topologies."

Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time."

They can be designed for high operating voltages without direct series connection of semiconductor elements. This has led to a rapid adoption within high-power applications such as high voltage direct current transmission. However, the overall hardware expenditure is generally greater than for conventional converters. Improving the operating range in the PQ-plane of the converter is thus desirable. In this work it is shown that optimisation of the internal variables of the converter can increase the power handling capability significantly for a given set of rating constraints. In this process optimal values for the circulating currents, the zero-sequence ac-side voltages and the average stored energy are sought. Also, a control algorithm is demonstrated by which the converter can be operated in the optimised operating point. Simulation results clearly indicate the feasibility of the proposed methodology."

In conventional SFPM machines, the influence of stator/rotor pole combination on the torque-speed characteristics is also investigated through 12/10, 12/13 and 12/14 SFPM machines. Compared with conventional SFPM machines, which exhibit limited speed range, infinite speed range is observed in multi-tooth, E-core and C-core SFPM machines, among which the highest average torque per ampere is achieved in E-core SFPM machine, albeit with relatively high torque ripples."

Since then further work has shown that the philosophy's fundamental principles were correct and it was applicable to multi-converter systems. Nevertheless, further work has led to refinements that enhance the basic concept to include converters operating with different control modes and system objectives.

The computer software simulation and the experimentation are made to investigate and verify the operation of proposed voltage sag detection. The detection time of FSRRF-based voltage sag detection is around one eighth of CSRRF-based voltage sag detection in the case of single-phase voltage sag and around one fifth in the case of two-phase voltage sag. This voltage sag detection can be used in any voltage sag or interruption compensation systems to improve their performance."

This paper focuses on the airflow which is intrinsically linked to the thermal behaviour of the machine as well as the windage power consumed to drive the air through the machine. A full CFD model has been used to analyse the airflow around all major components of the machine. Results have been experimentally validated and investigated. At synchronous speed the experimentally tested mass flow rate and torque were under predicted by 4% and 30% respectively by the CFD. A break-down of torque by component shows that the fan consumes approximately 87% of the windage torque."

This paper reviews possible DC/DC converter topologies, looking at device requirement, different voltage conversion ratio and fault management. The suitability of the converters considered, for use in a node in a HVDC offshore grid, is discussed. A resonant DC/DC converter topology is considered in detail and is modelled at a conversion ratio of two, and demonstrates high power efficiency."

Some commercial battery energy storage systems (BESS) already exist on the grid system, but these tend to use costly new or high performance batteries. Second life batteries should be available at lower cost than new batteries but reliability becomes an important issue as individual batteries may suffer from degraded performance or failure. Therefore converter topology design could be used to influence the overall system reliability. A detailed reliability calculation of different single phase battery-to-grid converter interfacing schemes is presented. A suitable converter topology for robust and reliable BESS is recommended."

The PV generator consists of a PV panel connected to a DC/AC converter via a DC-DC boost converter. The frequency regulator controls the boost converter and the voltage regulator controls the DC/AC converter. The proposed frequency regulator includes a frequency control module that changes the reference signal of a power control module when the frequency deviation is significant. An adaptive control scheme is employed to find the frequency control module equation and a nonlinear control scheme is used to find the active power control module equation. A backstepping control design method is employed to obtain the proposed voltage regulator equations. It consists of a module that uses the voltage deviation to generate the reference for a q-axis current controller. A module that maintains the DC-link voltage is also included. A backstepping control design method is also employed to find its equations. The proposed control system is evaluated in simulation. The results reveal that with the proposed control scheme, a PV generator behaves like a conventional synchronous generator when the grid frequency changes significantly."

That will be mostly due to governments and car manufacturers which are coordinating the effort to reduce urban pollution and greenhouse gas emission. The energy required for charging EV usually recovering in private parking places for many hours, will be mainly provided through smart charging boxes (“wall box”) managed by the (smart) grid control system of the LV network. In all other cases, EVs will be charged in fast charging stations or battery swap stations connected to the MV network. Such charging stations require high power during the day, especially when the network could be overloaded, hence there is the need to model the impact on the grid.

Due to the fact that liquids have a higher thermal capacity than air, liquid cooling has been used in high power radial flux electrical machines. This typically involves water being passed through a series of channels in the casing, which will be in thermal contact with the stator. Such a cooling configuration presents a number of thermal resistances between the heat source and the heat sink, limiting the heat transferred and hence the performance of the machine. The knowledge developed for radial flux machines, has been transferred to the design of AFPM machines, with the cooling channels embedded in the stator iron or in the stator plate for single rotor machines. Such liquid cooled machines rely on air-cooling for the copper end windings. The scope of this work is to present a temperature profile for a pole piece for a liquid cooled stator in YASA© electric machine. A high-resolution lumped-capacity thermal model is also presented, and compared to the experiment. The paper shows how a high-resolution model can reveal much more valuable information on the thermal aspects of the stator."

        "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) with a distributed drive train configuration offer great potential and flexibility for improving the system efficiency, performance, reliability as well as safety. This paper investigates a torque distribution scheme for a front and rear wheel driven EV in order to improve the drive train efficiency over a wide torque and speed range as a part of the EU funded P-MOB project. It has been shown the maximum efficiency is achieved if the total torque required by the vehicle is shared equally between the two identical motors. In addition, the distribution of the energy consumption over a New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) is analyzed and the regions of high speed, low torque are identified to have a high level of energy consumption, where the motor efficiency improvement in these regions is the most important. Therefore, this paper further proposes to operate just one motor to provide the total required torque in the low torque region. A clutch may be employed between one motor and gearbox (differential), thus “switching off” its idle loss (no-load loss, flux-weakening loss), and improving the drive train efficiency. An online optimized torque distribution algorithm has been devised based on the motor efficiency map to determine whether the second motor should be disengaged by the clutch in the low torque region. With the proposed optimization scheme, the drive train efficiency can be improved by 4% over the NEDC cycle. Experimental test results validate the proposed torque distribution strategy."

The median value of these frames is then used as the estimate of the background music at the current frame.

The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a number of real-world signals."

Though these techniques are very good at reducing lower order harmonics, efficiency of an inverter can't be effectively increased due to the presence of higher order harmonics. To eliminate these harmonics, a filter is designed."

This has resulted in a number of technical challenges for network protection including: sympathetic tripping of DG interface protection; blinding of feeder over-current (OC) protection; and deterioration of feeder OC protection grading. While the available literature typically analyses the impact of synchronous and induction DG (which is characterised by a high fault current contribution), this paper focuses on the impact of inverter-interfaced distributed generators (which are characterised by low fault current contributions). This paper quantifies the ‘tipping points’ at which protection problems occur by modelling a series of fault scenarios on a typical UK distribution network with inverter-interfaced DG, all simulations have been modelled in PSCAD. The results of this paper suggest that the occurrence of sympathetic tripping is highly dependent on the grid infeed fault level and the inverter-interfaced DGs fault location; protection blinding is unlikely to be a problem on UK power networks as it was not observed in any of the scenarios simulated in this paper; in all cases of protection grading deterioration the grading margin between the protection devices was found to increase meaning the protection devices never operated in an uncoordinated fashion. The tipping point at which these protection issues occurred was evaluated on a typical UK network. The conclusions drawn from these simulations may not be equally valid on future power networks that could employ novel network architectures and higher penetrations of DG."

This makes SAR very attractive for the systematic observation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface. However, current SAR systems are limited, in that a wide coverage can only be achieved at the expense of a degraded azimuth resolution. To overcome this limitation, an innovative concept is considered, Staggered-SAR, where the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is continuously varied. High-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) imaging is thus achieved without the need for a long antenna with multiple apertures."

The field is applied in the inter-electrode gap where the arc develops. The opening sequence may be separated into two temporal phases. During the first phase, the arc remains stuck at the same position as under zero field. This is ascribed to the existence of a sticking force, which overcomes the Laplace force. The sticking force is related to the high pressure existing in the plasma. During the second phase, the Laplace force dominates. The arc is blown out of the contact region in a time duration of 1 to 1.5 ms. A model is developed which provides a semiquantitative account of the experimental behavior."

By utilising the optimal 3rd order harmonic, the average torque of two 10-pole/12-slot machine can be increased by ~11%, while their torque ripple is only slightly increased by less than 1.5%, compared to machines employing magnet shaping techniques without the 3rd order harmonic."

It does not take any dynamic constraints of the underlying robot into account directly. This contribution introduces a new approach called \"timed elastic band\" which explicitly considers temporal aspects of the motion in terms of dynamic constraints such as limited robot velocities and accelerations. The \"timed elastic band\" problem is formulated in a weighted multi-objective optimization framework. Most objectives are local as they depend on a few neighboring intermediate configurations. This results in a sparse system matrix for which efficient large-scale constrained least squares optimization methods exist. Results from simulations and experiments with a real robot demonstrate that the approach is robust and computationally efficient to generate optimal robot trajectories in real time. The \"timed elastic band\" converts an initial path composed of a sequence of way points into a trajectory with explicit dependence on time which enables the control of the robot in real time. Due to its modular formulation the approach is easily extended to incorporate additional objectives and constraints."

The probability of detection of targets can be improved by fusion of non-coherent signals and/or plots from a few independents radars (channels) working in different bands. As an example multiband passive-active radar system working simultaneously in four bands is considered. The paper describes the concept of signal processing in this radar, similar to the MIMO method described in [1]. The fusion of signals is called centralised fusion (detection) and the fusion of plots is called decentralised fusion (detection). The signal processing algorithms described in the paper are based on the original concept that for the fusion of signals (i.e., the centralized fusion) the cueing method is used. It means that signals reflected from targets in multi bands are summed only if the targets have been detected by the decentralised fusion and are being tracked. Thus the centralised fusion takes place around the predicted target positions. The probability of detection versus range curves were calculated by a simulation process for the centralised and decentralised detection (fusion). Quantitative results of these simulations show the possibility for substantial improvement of the target detection probability or equivalently range and compared to single-band radar."

Then, based on the characters of smart grid systems, reference architecture for Smart Grid IoTs is introduced. Second, main security issues and information security protection requirements of Smart Gird IoTs are well studied. Considering the function of the IoTs application, IoTs in smart grid are classified into three areas with different importance, including electrical industrial control IoTs; gird information collection and process IoTs, and IoTs for power consumer interaction. And classified protection framework of internet of things security is described. The proposed framework can guide the security deployment for Smart Grid IoTs applications. Finally, trusted secure access control system for IoTs terminals is designed for the security protection of Internet of Things in Smart Grid."

The technique is similar to the conventional Sum of Squares (SOS) approach but is of lower computational complexity. Complexity reduction is achieved by checking the FFTs of two data blocks in a single calculation. The technique is based on checking the equivalence of the results of time and frequency domain calculations of the first sample of the circular convolution of the two blocks. In the case of error, the FFTs of both blocks must be recomputed. Assuming that errors are rare, this additional cost has negligible impact on the average number of operations per block."

This paper will give a brief description of a high speed bearingless disc drive, designed to reach speeds beyond 100.000rpm. Aside from special requirements such as rotor material strength and low stator loss characteristics, the control system also faces new tasks arising from the combined motor - bearing unit. Eventually, the operational behaviour of the constructed prototype on the basis of phase current amplitude and resulting rotor orbit is presented."

The algorithms considered are a central Kalman filter, Naive fusion and variants of the distributed Kalman filter. It is found that when the radar model is applied the distributed Kalman filter with globalised prediction is no longer exact, but feedback from the fusion centre or an approximation based on relaxed evolution can produce close to the optimal performance of a central Kalman filter. These variants of the distributed Kalman filter are preferred, as they do not require full communication."

The extension to continuous conduction mode (CCM), however, has not been considered due to the difficulties in compensating for the voltage drop in the secondary winding. From the possibility to predict the winding voltage drop using the magnetizing current and the transformer model, this paper presents a new observer method that can work accurately and smoothly in both CCM and DCM. The methodology can be combined with any controller to provide either output voltage regulation or output current regulation. The proposed sensing technique is verified by simulation."

This paper addresses the complete electromagnetic dimensioning of rotor and stator geometry. First, the normalized torque production capability of the machine is calculated. Then, reasonable stator and rotor configurations are determined with help of intuitive design parameters. A good design selection is achieved by comparing the results (e.g. power density) of all valid design configurations. The proposed procedure depicts the strong correlation between the operating modes, cooling and outer dimensions of SRM. In conclusion, this procedure reduces the initial design period significantly. Furthermore, it helps to optimize existing designs and question specifications if leading to inefficient designs."

Furthermore, under low load or other adverse environmental situations, the technique may not provide sufficient information to identify electrical connections in the initial or even advanced phases of electrical failure. This limitation stems from the large difference between the temperature of overheated electrical contact spots in a failing electrical interface and the temperature of the external surfaces of the electrical joint. This paper reports the results of calculations, based on a simple computer model, that illustrate the differences between the temperature of an electrical interface and the external surface temperature of the connection."

The paper treats typical challenges in sub-transmission and distribution grids with considerable wind penetration. A recent case of real life experience is highlighted, where several 69 kV directly connected SVCs were installed for grid stabilization in conjunction with a high degree of wind penetration. Some salient design features of SVC and STATCOM are presented, as well."

For the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbines, crowbar is a commonly used protection method to implement the LVRT capability. Based on analyzing the electric characteristic of the stator and rotor currents during the grid voltage dips in wind turbines with or without crowbar switching, the equation to estimate maximal faulty currents of stator and rotor with crowbar switching is derived. Then a crowbar resistance design method based on the faulty rotor current and the DC-link voltage was proposed, and the specific LVRT control strategy was discussed in this paper. The crowbar resistance can limit rotor fault current, DC-link over-voltage and protect rotor converter effectively during the grid voltage dip. At the same time, reactive power can be fed to the grid through both stator and grid-side converter. A typical 2MW DFIG system was used, the analysis and simulation results show that, with the help of appropriate protective resistor and the reasonable control strategy, the additional crowbar device can effectively help wind generator provide LVRT capability."

Experimental results show that the acoustic noise may be radiated by the radial vibration of the stator and the vibration of connected mechanical parts due to torque pulsation and stator torsional vibration. In the BLDC DTC prototype drive, the interaction between the field harmonics and PWM switching current harmonics appears to be the dominant source of radial vibration and acoustic noise. If the acoustic noise in both BLDC DTC and BLAC DTC is mainly caused by the interactions between the armature reaction field harmonics themselves, and between the armature reaction field harmonics and PM field harmonics, the BLDC DTC drive is expected to produce higher acoustic noise because the phase current and hence the armature reaction field of BLDC DTC drive is rich of non-triplen odd harmonics. However, if the acoustic noise radiated from BLDC DTC and BLAC DTC drives is largely attributed to PWM switching current harmonic induced vibrations, as found in this paper, the sound pressure level in a BLDC DTC drive may be lower than its BLAC counterpart."

In the current work we present a multistatic, multi frequency band, commensal, Radar system architecture and a suite of tools to design and implement such a system. The system we describe consists of spatially distributed transmitters and receivers, operating at different frequencies. The receivers do not process the direct signal, which is recorded independently, and shared by network. We outline the simulation tools we have developed to assist in the deployment of this technology in the most operationally effective way. These tools include multisite radar simulation and modelling of multistatic radar cross section and propagation using terrain elevation models."

The resonant converter corresponds to a three phase to single phase matrix converter which feeds a resonant tank (SRPL). Both predictive strategies allow soft commutations, thus, minimizing the switching losses. Previous work has analysed the effects of the control choice on an AC voltage power supply only. The main contribution of this paper is the consideration of the effect of the control choice on the input current as well HVDC quality produced by the power supply."

When they are operated at high electric loading, the influence of magnetic saturation is usually large. Furthermore, due to the geometric structure of some PM machine topologies, e.g. interior PM machines, such influence can be even more significant. The partial cross-coupling model, which considers that the PM flux is a function of q-axis current and the d- and q-axis inductances are functions of d- and q-axis currents, respectively, is simple but neglects the saturation to some extent. However, as shown by the frozen permeability method in this paper, it can accurately predict the torque-speed characteristics of fractional-slot PM machines having concentrated windings. The analysis is confirmed by experimental results."

A number of ITS applications such as Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS), Dynamic Route Guidance (DRG) and Urban Traffic Control (UTC) can benefit from improved prediction of traffic variables for the short-term future. Traffic prediction during abnormal condition, such as incidents, is especially important to these applications. However, this is an area not well-researched. This paper presents a novel improvement to a k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) based traffic predictor with Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique based data preprocessing. This SSA-kNN framework is implemented for short-term traffic prediction under both normal and incident traffic conditions. A key feature of this approach is the data pre-processing step, which is designed to accommodate the extremely noisy sensor inputs that arise during incident conditions. This paper compares the prediction accuracy of the SSA-kNN approach with three other commonly used machine learning methods, kNN, Grey System Model (GM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Moreover, the sensitivity of traffic prediction accuracy to various kNN design parameters is explored. The results show that the proposed SSA-kNN based approach has the best prediction accuracy among the methods used in this study, especially during non-recurring incidents. The concept behind the proposed method can be extended to other machine learning tools to improve the accuracy of short-term traffic forecasting models."

This prevents the DC link voltage rise as a result of trapped energy. This reduces the voltage and current stresses on the switching devices. Also, the strategy ensures the converters remain connected to the AC network to provide the necessary voltage support, within the converter reactive power capability. The recovery strategy is implemented by introducing a flywheel energy storage system based on induction machine in parallel with the grid side inverter. Due to the parallel combination of the grid side inverter and flywheel induction machine (FW-IM), the trapped energy in the DC link during AC faults can be eliminated; as a result of finding another path for the power of the wind turbines during AC faults. To illustrate the feasibility of the proposed HVDC system, this paper assesses its dynamic performance during steady-state and network alterations, including its response to AC side faults."

Due to tight regulation requirements modern point-of-load converters have very small output ripple. This small output ripple fails to generate a suitable piece-wise linear modulation waveform for the hysteretic comparator. This paper presents a fully digital Synthetic Ripple Modulator (SRM) comprising of a hysteretic comparator, a ripple synthesizer, and a voltage error amplifier for tight output voltage regulation. The ripple synthesizer realizes a high-quality low-cost current sensors by creating a piece-wise linear synthetic ripple using sensed converter voltages. This artificial ripple is then added to the output voltage and fed as a carrier to the hysteretic comparator. This improves the large signal dynamics of the converter, especially in low voltage application. Analysis and experimental results on a 2 V/10 A, 20 W single phase prototype are presented to verify the operation of the proposed digital SRM."

This paper is concentrated on the identification of critical components in power distribution systems, more from a reliability viewpoint, to be planned for maintenance schedules. A new straightforward scheme is proposed based on the common load point reliability indices which can easily get through the components prioritization. The presented scheme can then mathematically find the most critical ones to be put under reliability centered maintenance (RCM). Since the maintenance plans are then applied where necessary, the proposed method helps in more effectively reaching the benchmarked reliability indices of a distribution utility, with the minimum costs and the maximum benefits. The effectiveness and applicability of the offered scheme are finally reflected in its application on a real distribution system, i.e. Swedish distribution network belonging to the BIRKA Nat distribution system in the Stockholm City area."

This paper shows that a typical radial HVDC link would have an energy availability of 96.5% based on estimated reliability indices from publically available data and that the submarine cable is the component which has the greatest effect on the scheme's availability. The regional HVDC grid analysed in this paper is shown to have a higher energy availability than an equivalent radial scheme, providing additional capacity is built into the grid. Furthermore, cost-benefit analysis shows the link between a scheme's availability and profitability."

        "abstract": "Background: The estimation technique Planning Poker is common in agile software development. The cards used to propose an estimate in Planning Poker do not include all numbers, but for example only the numbers 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100. We denote this, somewhat inaccurately, a Fibonacci scale in this paper. In spite of the widespread use of the Fibonacci scale in agile estimation, we do not know much about how this scale influences the estimation process. Aim: Better understanding of the effect of going from a linear scale to a Fibonacci scale in effort estimation. Method: We conducted two empirical studies. In the first study, we gave computer science students the same estimation task. Half of the students estimated the task using the Fibonacci scale and the other half a linear scale. The second study included four estimation teams, each composed of four software professionals, estimating the effort to complete the same ten tasks. Two of the teams estimated the first five tasks using the Fibonacci scale and the last five using the linear scale. The two other teams used the scales in the opposite sequence. Results: We found a median decrease in the effort estimates of 60% (first study) and 26% (second study) when using a Fibonacci scale instead of the traditional linear scale. The scale difference in the effort estimates decreased as the developers' skill increased. Conclusion: The use of a Fibonacci scale, and possibly other non-linear scales, is likely to affect the effort estimates towards lower values compared to linear scales. A possible explanation for this scale-induced effect is that people tend to be biased towards toward the middle of the provided scale, especially when the uncertainty is substantial. The middle value is likely to be perceived as lower for the Fibonacci than for the line"

Therefore, a modified technique, based on artificial neural network (ANN) combined with linear regression, is applied on the KSA electrical network dependent on its historical data to predict the electrical load demand forecasting up to year 2020. This technique was compared with extrapolation of trend curves as a traditional method (Linear regression models). Application results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective. The application of neural networks prediction shows the capability and the efficiently of the proposed techniques to obtain the predicting load demand up to year 2020."

To utilize solar pv to fullest, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is incorporated in controller. However, in case when the state of charge (SoC) of battery is high and system is partially loaded, excess power flows into the battery, thereby reducing the life of battery. Technique suggested in literature use output (battery) voltage controllers. However, it is shown in this paper that output voltage controlled dc-dc converter fed by solar pv may lead to instability. To address these limitations, a charge controller scheme is proposed in this paper. This scheme ensures that the battery voltage remains below its gassing voltage. Salient features of the proposed scheme are optimal utilization of solar pv and battery capacities without effecting life of battery. The effectiveness of the scheme is verified through detailed simulation study. To confirm the viability of the scheme, experimental studies are carried out on a scaled-down laboratory prototype developed for the purpose."

These dc signatures were also compared to previously obtained ac signatures using the same materials and methods to show differences between ac and dcarcing. This work is useful to those who want to gain an understanding of RF currents generated in arcs, especially for those developing arc fault sensing devices.

This paper explains how DC side harmonic currents are produced by PWM inverters and how they interact with the capacitors and cable inductances on the system. When multiple PWM drives are connected together there are multiple resonant frequencies and avoiding resonances may be impossible. A example design is done which shows that the inherent losses in Electrolytic capacitors can sometimes provide sufficient damping but that the optimum design of low loss Metalised film capacitors does not work with out additional damping resistors or eliminating the dc bus inductance. A full DC harmonic study is necessary combining all the harmonics sources and the multiple natural system resonances to have a better understanding of how much damping is required and where to add it."

The factors inducing the oscillations of DC-link voltage of the full-scale frequency converter during grid voltage dips are analyzed. A novel control strategy is proposed to suppresses the DC-link voltage oscillations and enhance the low voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of PMSG-based wind turbine. The generator-side converter is controlled to maintain a stable DC-link voltage, while the grid-side converter is controlled to provide a dynamic coordinated control for the active and reactive power output according to the grid voltage amplitude variations during grid faults. The simulation results implemented in Matlab/Simulink show that the proposed control strategy not only improves the stability of PMSG by means of suppressing the DC-link voltage oscillation, but also provides a dynamic reactive power support to restraint the disturbance of the grid voltage."

First, we explain how its design and work, then the kinematic model of the robotic platform is presented considering nonholonomic constraints and the inverse kinematics of the manipulator is described. In order to generate a visualized user interface, we adopt a new development in information technology, which is known as virtual reality (VR). All different movements and manual control of the manipulator are shown in a 3-D virtual environment. Teleoperation is realized by using WiFi to transmit the commands and remote desktop from the lower computer to the upper computer.

High-resistance grounding fault current isn't sufficient to trigger switches, which may expand the accident or turn into potential hazards. In order to overcome the limits of the existing methods (such as signal injecting method, resistance method and so), developing a novel fault approach by using both the feeding current and voltage to detect and locate the high-resistance grounding fault in DC railway traction system is necessary. The simulation results prove that the exact fault location can be accurately predicted in this way. Through comparison of several different analysis methods, this paper concludes that with the digital signal processing the location can be executed more precisely. Extensive simulations with diverse fault conditions are performed to verify the means."

In multicarrier schemes the large dynamic range of the signal is a common problem, both FBMC and OFDM signals have high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). If nonlinear distortions are present, this large PAPR can lead to spectral regrowth causing harmful interference in the neighboring frequency bands. In this paper clipping-based PAPR-reduction schemes aided to reduce the PAPR of FBMC signal are presented. A comparison is given for both transmitter and receiver oriented methods."

The connection of distributed generation (DG) units causes a reduction in the efficacy of protection systems coordination and, in some cases, an increase of operating times. Coordination studies aim to guarantee the protection selectivity in a diversity of fault situations, also considering topological changes. Consequently, sometimes a correct protection operation at every point of the system in every possible situation cannot be guaranteed. The proposed MAS uses communication between agents to achieve on-line coordination. In order to evaluate the approach, simulation tests of a real system were executed and the protection operating times using the proposed methodology are compared with the operating time of existing relays. Results show that this approach provides a noticeable reduction of protection operating time and there is also an improvement of selectivity."

There are blind people who use active versions of the technique as an augmentation to the long stick and can even perform remarkable tasks such as riding a bicycle. Those who are expert in this practise can evaluate range, location, size, shape and texture of objects. This provides a very powerful basis for perception and cognition and is somewhat beyond that which is routinely achieved by radar systems. This example of “sight by sound” makes an ideal candidate to study in order to understand and articulate the cognitive methods used. Subsequently artificial forms of cognition can be synthesised and applied to radar and sonar sensing. In this paper we report on an initial examination of human echolocation by presenting and analysing transmitted and received waveforms generated via “tongue-clicking”."

Finally, the image is segmented by assigning each pixel to the cluster with the highest membership. The method was validated on both synthetic and in vivo ultrasound images. It outperformed the traditional fuzzy c-means methods including MsFCM by 39.6% and 13.6%, in terms of the Pratt's figure of merit and segmentation accuracy, respectively.

After their installation they generate electricity from the solar irradiation without emitting greenhouse gases. Electrical energy presently comprises about fifteen percent of energy demand in the world, but this percentage is considerably higher for developed societies and tends to increase. Electricity consumption is strongly correlated with economic growth; economic growth allows further use of electric appliances which in turn increases electricity demand. The output power produced by photovoltaic systems is directly related to the amount of solar energy acquired by the system, and so it is extremely important to track the sun's position according to its trajectory with accuracy. In this paper the deigning and implementation of a solar tracker is explained which is using a stepper motor and light sensor and automatically follows sun's trajectory. This tracker can be used for increasing power collection efficiency by tracking the sun. An MPPT solar tracking system has been designed, implemented and presented in this paper."

This paper proposes building DC grids using VSC converters based on LCL passive circuits that enable inherent regulation of DC fault currents. The DC grids with LCL AC/DC converters will not have high DC fault currents and do not require very fast DC fault isolation. The paper describes mechanical DC circuit breakers that can be used at the ends of each DC cable in similar manner and with similar protection systems as with AC transmission systems. The advantage and feasibility of this method in DC fault isolation is studied using a 1GW three terminal HVDC test system simulated on PSCAD platform."

        "abstract": "The paper discusses the problem of implementing the state observers associated with direct field orientation (DFO) of motor drives using trapezoidal integration (Tustin method). Typically, the discrete-time equations of observers are obtained by emulating the continuous-time equations using the Euler method (forward rectangular rule). With Euler integration, the resulting equations are simple and the real-time implementation requires low computational effort. However, Euler-based observers become inaccurate if a small sampling time cannot used or if the motor drive operates at high frequency-this is because, as the sampling time increases, the Euler approximation of the integral starts losing more and more area from under the curve. The Tustin method (trapezoidal integration) offers an interesting alternative it is theoretically a more accurate integration method, however, it is more complicated. The paper discusses the emulation procedure required to discretize continuous-time observers based on trapezoidal integration. The permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is used as an example of a time-varying plant-the paper develops a trapezoidal integration based observer for the PMSM and compares this with an Euler-based observer in terms of computational complexity and performance. The two observers are simulated comparatively in order to establish the conditions when trapezoidal integration outperforms the Euler method."

FM Band Commensal Radar (radar that uses another system's EM emissions) produces a Range versus Doppler plot, where the Doppler resolution is very precise due to the long integration time, but range resolution is at best poor due to the narrow broadcast channel bandwidth. Thus, tracking that relies mostly on Doppler seems most sensible for this type of radar."

In this paper, measurements are assumed to be taken from low cost cameras, e.g. the recently launched Microsoft Kinect sensor. Information about the environment will be extracted using sophisticated feature extraction and data association algorithms. Here, the challenge lies in the computational complexity of the image processing algorithms. Therefore, a feature extraction algorithm based on the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithm will be discussed. Further, a novel efficient and robust data association algorithm for Visual SLAM features will be presented. Initial experiments were conducted in an office environment, showing that the proposed Visual SLAM algorithm achieves precise localization while approaching real-time performance.

In this paper, we widen this path to create a corridor of forwarding nodes. Within this corridor, data can be split and joined at different nodes as the data travels through the corridor towards the destination node. To split data, decode-and-forward OFDMA is used since with OFDMA, one can exploit the benefits of opportunistically allocating different subcarriers to different nodes according to their channel conditions. To avoid interference, each subcarrier is only allocated once per hop. It is assumed that only local channel state information (CSI) for the next hop towards the destination is available at the nodes, i.e. it can not be guaranteed that a certain node is able to forward its received data in the next hop. This leads to additional transmission phases decreasing the overall network throughput. In this paper, different opportunistic forwarding algorithms are presented which differ in the resource allocation strategy and in the amount of cooperation required between the nodes. Simulations show that in multihop networks, corridor-based routing using opportunistic forwarding with a proper resource allocation strategy outperforms conventional unipath routing approaches in terms of achievable throughput, especially in case of a node drop out."

Their ability to directly measure and provide the voltage and current phasors at the PMU location offers numerous possibilities for ascertaining information relating to the state and health of the power system. Typical applications of PMUs in distribution networks include: state estimation, dynamic stability supervision, instability prediction and control, protection and fault location, and power quality monitoring [2]. This paper presents a brief overview of the applications of PMU-enabled distribution network functions, with a focus on loss of mains (LOM) protection using a model that is representative of a distribution network incorporating DG. The paper reports on extensive simulations that have been carried out in order to develop a PMU-based system that can detect (very quickly) loss-of mains conditions under situations where local (i.e. potentially islanded) load and DG output is very closely balanced. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the developed PMU-based LOM system can identify and differentiate between load transients, local short circuits and true loss of mains conditions under a variety of different scenarios. Future activities in the project are also presented."

The new plants are connected to the existing natural gas transmission network leading to a high interdependence between it and the respective electric power system. Therefore, the failure events occurring in the natural gas network can cause interruption of gas supply to one or more power generating units connected to it. This means that there will be a significant impact on the secure and the reliable operation of the power system. For this reason, an additional reliability analysis is required in order to examine the impact of the natural gas network on the operation of the respective power system. The purpose of this paper is to describe an efficient methodology that is based on the Monte - Carlo sequential simulation approach in order to realistically simulate the annual operation of the natural gas transmission systems and calculate the relevant reliability indices of connection nodes for the electric power plants using natural gas. The analysis of a combined system based on the Hellenic electric power system and the natural gas transmission system is presented assuming alternative case studies while the impact of their interdependence is determined. These results are compared and useful conclusions are obtained."

The proposed control system can be implemented on any WECS and requires minimum training for the ANN as well as a small number of artificial neurons. During the training of the ANN, the WECS needs to operate simultaneously with a wind measurement system, until a sufficient amount of data is collected on all operating regions of the wind turbine and the wind turbine characteristics are determined. Next, the ANN is trained, having the rotational speed of the shaft and the power output of the generator as input signals. As a result, the wind turbine can be driven to the optimum rotor speed very fast and with high precision so as the MPPT controller can follow the fast dynamics of the wind speed. Several simulation results are presented for the validation of the effectiveness of the suggested MPPT control scheme and demonstrate the operational improvements."

In this study, a concentrated winding electric machine is designed for industrial applications. Although, in concentrated winding, mutual coupling between two adjacent coils is assumed to be zero, finite element analysis indicates that significant coupling may exist. Studies indicate that the coupling phenomena degrades fault tolerant capabilities of the concentrated winding structure. This paper, first, investigates the existence of mutual coupling then presents a new concentrated winding structure which still exploits benefits of conventional concentrated winding."

The control goal is to make the FESS with limited capacity to provide energy as more as possible, so that the wind farm output can be smoothed further. In the proposed control scheme, the desired output of wind farm with FESS is determined by a sliding mean filter (SMF) with the wind power series as input. Then, considering the capacity of FESS is finite, a set point corrector is employed to correct the active power set point of FESS according to the state-of-charge (SOC), so as to maintain the speed of flywheel in proper range. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by using the actual power output data of a wind farm, and the simulation results illustrate the satisfying capability of the scheme."

The hybrid method can estimate voltage phasor at each node by minimizing difference between measured and calculated values of state variables and also, it can guarantee observability of distribution system under normal operation conditions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of new procedure, simulation studies are applied on 30-bus radial test feeder. Finally, achievement results for convergence characteristic of DSE solution and estimation error of state variables with regard to the optimal placement and numbers of PMUs in distribution test feeder have been presented."

The algorithm starts with colour to grey scale conversion followed by contrast stretching. Then single scale retinex enhancement is performed to increase the contrast, reduce global variance and improve the background uniformity of the image. Otsu's binarisation method is then used to dichotomize the image and finally, morphological dilation is performed to preserve stroke connectivity of the document characters by bridging any gaps resulting from the thresholding process. Computer simulation experiments have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show a significant improvement over the Otsu's method in terms shadow removal, document legibility and optical character recognition. The results also compare well with the state of the art Sauvola's method results."

The effect of laminating the magnets and the losses in the anisotropic sleeve are analysed with 3D simulations, using simplifications determined with 2D simulations. The anisotropic resistivity of the sleeve roughly doubles the losses compared to an isotropic sleeve, while laminating the magnets in n slices reduces the losses by 1/n1.8."

Echoic flow can be computed in a number of forms, the simplest being the ratio of range, to range rate. This provides a direct measure of the time for a radar system and a detected object to collide with each other. Its derivative is a measure of the intensity of the collision. Thus these two quantities provide a powerful foundation for autonomous navigation, tracking and guidance. In this paper we explain echoic flow and show through simulation how it can be used as a basis for radar based autonomous navigation."

        "abstract": "Materials used in the connectors in cars are expected to have very low and stable electrical resistance and high resistance against corrosion. The environmental and mechanical factors strongly influence mentioned parameters. Thus numerous coating systems consisting of pure metallic materials, noble and non noble, doped as well as soft coatings were developed and studied. In this work the degradation mechanisms of homogeneous bronze/nickel/silver coatings systems were studied under fretting loadings. Five silver layer thicknesses (1.3μm, 2μm, 3μm, 4μm and 5μm) were investigated. Different test procedures have been applied to identify first the transition from partial to gross slip conditions and establish the electrical endurances as a function of the applied displacement amplitudes in the finite endurance gross slip condition. Very basic criteria have been introduced to rationalize and compare the electrical endurance as a function of the coating thickness. It is shown that the evolution of the electrical endurance vs. the coating thickness displays a nearly linear increase above a threshold coating thickness. Below this threshold, silver was found to delaminate from nickel interlayer in the very earlier stage of the test inducing very short electrical endurance."

The switching-speed related-part can be reduced by using a high-speed FET and high-power gate driver; however, Coss-related loss remains constant and makes efficiency worse especially in low-load region. We propose a new soft switching PFC circuit designed for Coss-related loss reduction and demonstrated that the PFC loss was reduced by half at 20% load with both SPICE simulation and prototype circuit. In the data server case, the average load of the PSU is usually less than 30% [1] when redundant PSU is used, so this circuit is very effective for energy saving of data center."

Electric Vehicles (EVs) have been the centre of attention in recent years because they can be used to form a bidirectional connection to the power grid. In this scheme an aggregation of electric vehicles can be used to provide ancillary services for a power grid which is known as Vehicle to Grid (V2G) concept. Aggregation of EVs in a parking lot can be considered as a distributed generation (DG) unit. During off-peak hours, power grid provides electrical energy for charging the EVs in a parking lot while during peak hours some part of their stored energy should be given back to the grid. In this paper, it is considered that the parking lot belongs to a distribution company. Such parking lots is considered as a distributed generation (DG) unit which may offer some advantages like emission reduction, power quality improvement, reliability enhancement and deferral in distribution upgrades."

        "abstract": "In this paper, the power system and operation of a Rubber Tyred Gantry (RTG) Crane is outlined and the process of creating a suitable mathematical model to allow testing of energy storage is presented. The UK Governments emissions targets combined with the rising cost of fuel are causing industry to look for fuel efficiency technology and strategies. Critically the plant machines cannot be taken off-line for testing due to the cost implications. So a method of evaluating efficiency solutions avoiding this, must be devised. The results show that a SimPowerSystems model is capable of providing a computer test bench fulfilling this need."

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a microgrid emergency control strategy-the stratified controllable load shedding optimization. Firstly the method stratifies controllable load into different levels based on the degree of load importance and load frequency regulation effect coefficient (KL). Then the optimization model is put forward. It is difficult to deal with since it is a nonlinear mixed integer programming problem. This paper proposes a new step-by-step solution and its principle is described in detail. The feasibility of the method is verified by carrying out with Matlab. The modified IEEE 9-bus distribution system is used to simulate a microgrid. The emergency controllable load stratification is put forward, and the results are listed. By comparing with the traditional method of load shedding and analysing the results, we can conclude that the proposed method is reasonable and effective."

        "abstract": "Effective utilization of electricity is one of global objectives for realization of sustainable societies. In order to utilize electricity supply systems efficiently, it is necessary to level our electricity demand by shifting peak time electricity demand to non-peak time. Demand response (DR) is expected as the key technology to level electricity demand by demand peak cut or shift, and it is necessary to expand the amount of the peak cut and shift capacity. In the US and some regions, various demand response programs have been implemented and the amount of peak load reduction has increased in the US. However, most of demand reduction resources are from “Commercial and Industrial” and “Wholesale” sectors and expansion of DR program utilization in residential sector is one of the important challenges to increase effectiveness of demand response programs. This paper reorganizes current existing demand response programs systematically and clarifies their characters. And using the result, an evaluation approach of demand response programs are proposed by focusing on the benefit of these programs for expansion of peak load reduction amount in residential side."

        "abstract": "Dynamic spectrum access technologies such as cognitive radio aim to improve the current spectrum utilisation by allowing opportunistic spectrum access to the licensed frequency bands without causing interference. However, in order to this, better understanding of the spectrum usage pattern is important. In this context, this paper presents the 24-hour spectrum survey of an outdoor radio environment in a suburban area in Johor Bahru, Malaysia in the frequency bands from 30-3000 MHz. The objectives are to investigate how the different services being allocated are utilised and identify bands that have low or no active utilisation. The result of the spectrum measurement reveals that the utilisation is 11.29% with a significant amount of spectrum underutilized is at frequencies above 1 GHz. The outcome of the study suggests that cognitive radio could indeed improve the spectrum utilisation and become the platform to provide for future wireless services. However, these studies are preliminary and future long term spectrum survey is required in better understanding and modelling of the actual spectrum usage pattern for cognitive radio applications."
